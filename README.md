# VU and iter system tags not output

Run `make`. This will compare the CSV outputs of two versions of k6 - specifically the `vu` column and the `iter` column. 

After running `make`, to see the raw CSVs generated by k6, see [the working one](results/working.csv) and [the broken one](results/broken.csv).
